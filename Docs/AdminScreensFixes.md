## Backend API Integration

### Verified Endpoints:
- `GET /api/bookings` - All bookings (Admin/Staff)
- `GET /api/bookings/my-bookings` - User's bookings (Owner)

- `GET /api/records/my-records` - User's records (Owner)
- `GET /api/users` - All users (Admin)
- `PATCH /api/bookings/{id}/status` - Update booking status
- `POST /api/records` - Create medical record
- `PUT /api/records/{id}` - Update medical record

### Authentication:
- Session-based authentication using JSESSIONID cookies
- Proper credentials handling for cross-origin requests
- Role-based access control maintained

## Testing Recommendations

### 1. Admin Login
```
Email: admin@example.com
Password: admin123
```

### 2. Test Scenarios:
1. **All Bookings:** Navigate to All Bookings and verify data loads
2. **Medical Records:** Navigate to Medical Records and verify data loads
3. **User Management:** Navigate to Users and verify user list loads
4. **Create Records:** Test creating new medical records with date picker
5. **Update Bookings:** Test updating booking statuses

### 3. Debug Information:
- Check browser console for debug logs
- Verify API calls are being made to correct endpoints
- Confirm session cookies are being sent

## Browser Compatibility

### Optimized for Web:
- **Chrome/Edge:** Full compatibility
- **Firefox:** Full compatibility
- **Safari:** Full compatibility
- **Mobile Browsers:** Responsive design maintained

### Web-Specific Features:
- Custom date picker works better than native iOS picker on web
- Proper button sizing for mouse interaction
- Scroll behavior optimized for web

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements:
1. **Real-time Updates:** WebSocket integration for live data updates
2. **Advanced Filtering:** More sophisticated filtering options
3. **Bulk Operations:** Multi-select for bulk actions
4. **Export Features:** PDF/Excel export capabilities
5. **Audit Logging:** Track all admin actions

## Deployment Notes

### Environment Setup:
- Ensure backend is running on `http://localhost:8080`
- Frontend runs on `http://localhost:3000`
- CORS properly configured for cross-origin requests

### Production Considerations:
- Update API base URL in `AppConstants.baseUrl`
- Configure proper HTTPS endpoints
- Set up proper session management
- Implement proper error logging
